This project contains the source code and results of the simulations for
the paper entitled "Host Overload Detection for Dynamic Consolidation
of Virtual Machines in Clouds Based on a Markov Chain Model and
Multisize Sliding Window Workload Estimation", which has been
submitted to the Special Issue of TPDS on Cloud Computing.

## Usage

First, run the script to install Michael Thomas Flanagan's Java Scientific 
Library (http://www.ee.ucl.ac.uk/~mflanaga/java/) to the local Maven repository:

> ./install_flanagan

To download the dependencies and compile the source code:

> lein compile

To create Eclipse project files:

> lein eclipse

To run the unit tests:

> lein midje

Please see examples of running simulation in the included scripts: run-*.sh

## Workload data

The workload data have been obtained from the CoMon project, a monitoring 
infrastructure for PlanetLab (http://comon.cs.princeton.edu/). The data used
in the simulations in the CSV format are available at https://github.com/beloglazov/tpds-2012-workload

The workload data have been transformed in the required internal data format and 
is located in the workload/ directory.

The file name format is the following: planetlab_n_otf1_otf2_index

    where:

        n     - the number of different simulation runs
        otf1  - the minimum OTF value of each CPU utilization trace
        otf2  - the maximum OTF value after the first 30 time frames of each CPU 
                utilization trace
        index - the index of the workload file
